  <h1> Can Dogs See in the Dark?</h1>
    <p>
      Dogs can see well in dark or low-light situations. This is because their eyes are anatomically different from humans’ eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have more rods in the retina than humans, so their eyes are more sensitive to motion and light. This allows your dog to pick up on small movements and detect the presence of strangers or prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other predatory animals, dogs have a layer of reflective membrane at the back of their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    This membrane bounces light not absorbed by rods to the retina, which allows the eye to take in additional light and strengthens their nighttime vision. This also makes it look as if dogs’ eyes glow in the dark.
